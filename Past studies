Introduction
From engineering understanding, the Ramu 2 Project started as per an initiative of PPL to boost
its Hydro Potential from the existing YTOD and Ramu 1 Installation. The Project was then passed
to KCH (IPBC at the time) to further GoPNG support for guarantee of the project. Initial sizing was
done through feasibility studies run by KCH to gauge the size of the complex and was tendered
out to engage an investor for the Project.
This Grid Impact Study is done to give PPL Management, PPL Board, KCH, Ministry for State
owned Enterprise and the Prime Minister’s Office the understanding for the Impact of the Ramu
2 Complex on the Ramu System. Areas covered in the Ramu 2 PPA highlight the performance
testing of the Ramu 2 complex but does not cover the Ramu System.
The system study includes; load flow analysis, short-circuit analysis, voltage, and stability
analysis. The Modelling data is compiled from PPL intellectual Property data on the Ramu System
collected in conjunction with the Voltex Engineering group Brisbane Australia in 2018 and the
Ramu 2 complex data from the Schenzen Energy Group given on ninth of July 2020 for the
completion of the Grid Impact Study. The DigSlient Powerfactory is used for the power system
simulations and all relevant calculations and results.
The report will provide technical evidence from the Utility on the connection of Ramu 2 and its
impact on the Ramu system.

Operating Frequency
During single outage contingency, the system frequency deviation should be less than ±1Hz. In
the case of multiple outage contingency or when the system is in a state of emergency, the system
frequency may range between 47Hz and 52Hz. No generating units shall be disconnected from
the system without the prior approval of the system operator unless it is specified in the operating
procedures and it complies with the automatic device or protection settings.
Event Deviation
Single outage contingency 49Hz-51Hz

Table 13 Load data from the Ramu System
Loading used for the modelling will be based on actual data of current feeders in the Ramu system
with an additional incremental growth based on the country’s GDP and energy development plan.
This translates to an energy growth rate of 3% nominal and 6% at high growth. The projects of
the load will be done on year 2025 as per the timeline given in current discussions with all parties.
This pushes the Load scaling done on the model to 116%. Below is an example of how the loads
are modelled as a time characteristic curve to give the diversity of peaking in the Ramu System.

Table 16 Results of Scenario Screening
It is of the opinion that the Ramu 2 through Singsing through Erap to Wafi Golpu with Ramu NiCo
Load and Timini Sub is the best option in terms of:
1. Supply Security to Wafi Golpu
2. Capacity utilization of Ramu 2
3. Utilization of the current infrastructure of PPL
4. Operational requirements and ease of operation to the Ramu System
Scenario 1 can be used with respect to PPL not getting involved in Ramu 2 development. Scenario
4 although with a double circuit to Wafi Golpu can be considered based on ease of transmission
system to Erap.

Ramu System Model Verification
The model verification process for this study is important as it underpins the validity of the outputs
generated and the results given. This process is to first confirm the base model with the current
system results. The next setup is to verify that the data for the Ramu 2 complex is valid and
applicable for use in the Ramu system. Comparison of control inputs with data given. Then finally
stability indices to show a valid convergence at Steady State, RMS and Oscillatory Stability.
Before Connection the Proposed Ramu 2
It is important to gauge the base case of the Ramu System to ensure the complex variable of the
study is solely at the differentiated parameters of the Ramu 2 Complex, the Inter Connection
Facilities and the Grid Connected Facilities.

Figure 18 Ramu 2 Unit 2 Generator Load Control Governor Settings
The Thyne 500 excitation system proposed to be used by the Ramu 2 units is a cascaded
regulator structure from IEEE standard 421.5. PPL has no similar excitation controllers in its
systems. Its AVR is a PID structured with a feedback loop that can be used as a LDC. It’s over
and under excitation limiters as modelled with a Power System Stabilizer are the main input
factors to the AVR with the Vref. It is understood that with the larger sized units the complexity of
the Excitation system is a necessary addition for Ramu 2. The Thyne 500 structure is a ST8C
model as shown below.
Its Governor system is a TC1703XL digital governor with a Pelton Hydraulic System. Built by
Andritz, it is a parallel PID structure with a modular arrangement. Based on the technical data
given, the assumed model for the Ramu 2 Governor systems is a HYGOV standard.
Assumptions on Model from Data
It is imperative to get the control functions of the Ramu 2 Units as close to the proposed technical
data given to ensure the closest resemblance of the System interaction is achieved. The following
are areas to prove the validity of the model used.

The DigSlient Model utilize for the excitation system is the ST7B as the ST8C model was not
available in the PF Library. The option on building a UTC model was not considered due to the
time requirement of the report. The ST7B is the closest representation of the ST8C with the
exception of the AVR structure a PI instead of a PID. Engineering believe this can be negated as
additional gain changes and increased internal excitation can still be modelled to resemble the
ST8C. This was modelled with a PQ curve limiter

Taken from a singular Busbar as reference buses for individual units, the initial conditions are
comparatively processed in the AVR, PSS and Governor models before an input is sent to the
generator model.

Load Flow Analysis
The load flow analysis will give a steady state account of the system with the connection of Ramu
2. Steady state results give a snap shot view on how the power flows from generation points to
load areas and gives a representation of voltage and capacity of equipment on the Ramu system.
Influence of Ramu 2
At a steady state level, the following are the immediate grid impact areas for the Utility. This is in
the case of Ramu 2 at minimum take or pay capacity and Wafi Golpu at 10MW Full Load. The
model has had additional static compensation areas included to ensure convergence of the
system.

Generation Adequacy Analysis
The ability of the power system to be able to supply system load under all possible load conditions
is known as System Adequacy. Specifically this relates to the ability of the generation to meet the
system demand while also considering typical system constraints. Constraints such as
Generation unavailability due to fault or maintenance requirements, variation in system load on a
monthly, hourly and minute by minute basis and variations in output.
The Modelling tool in PowerFactory used for this is the Generation Adequacy Tool with the Monte
Carlo method, a sampling simulation. This determined the contribution of generation to overall
system capacity and to determine the probability of Loss of Load (LOLP) and the Expected
Demand Not Supplied (EDNS).
Using uniform random number sequences a random system state is generated with the Monte
Carlo method. This system state consists of random generating operating states and of random
time points. The generating operating states will have a corresponding generation power output,
whereas the time points will have a corresponding power demand. The value of Demand Not
Supplied (DNS) is then calculated for such state.
𝐷𝑁𝑆 = 􀷍 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑 − 􀷍𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
This process is done for a specific number of iterations. At the end of the simulation, the values
of the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP), Loss of Load Expectancy (LOLE), Expected Demand Not
Supplied (EDNS), and Loss of Energy Expectancy (LOEE) indices are calculated as average
values from all the iterations performed.

The simulation used 100,000 iterations with an assumed 14.5% technical loss. Power flow was
based on the previous Load Flow of Wafi Golpu at 55MW, Ramu 2 with 3 Units online and at a
load scaling of 116%. The above results were given for the simulation. Initial assessment of the
results were worrying with such a high LOLP percentile finding. This was later verified with the
logic that Ramu 2 being the largest Plant on the system without it intact in the demand scenario
will yield a high percentage LOLP at 57.302%. EDNS was also correlated at 4.641MW.

Short-Circuit Analysis
All assumptions are as per the Operation Fault Current, CCT and Duration section above. The
IEC 60909 suggested approach is done for the short-circuit analysis. The load flow cases adopted
in the calculation is the peak load condition of the Ramu system after Ramu 2 and the
interconnection facilities is connected. The load flow analysis for the system grid structure and
generator conditions are used here.

The IEC 60909 calculation was used for the short circuit study simulated at peak loading and at
maximum 3 phase fault current. Base case for the model was taken from the Initial condition load
flow results to ensure there was convergence of the model before the analysis was run. A main
assumption was the grounding arrangement of the Ramu 2 plant and Wafi Golpu substation. This
will affect the impedance levels generated from the model and is something that can be further
investigated with parties involved to resolve the best expected fault current levels for the Ramu
System.

Figure 36 Ramu System Short Circuit Results
The above results are inflated from the initial base condition of the Ramu System as the increase in
Generation and load will affect the short circuit impedance values in the system. The areas of Wafi Golpu
and Ramu 2 above are above the fault level areas highlighted for PPL 132kV systems. This is perceived to
be not only because of the larger generation and load source, but the ground arrangements used. The
model of the Ramu 2 unit star point arrangement is solid grounding which PPL Engineering believes will
be changed to reduce the peak Ip current at the station. This is an important note to ensure short circuit
levels are with PPL and regulatory requirement in the interconnection. This will be addressed in the design
phase of the connection agreement.
Similarly Wafi Golpu has a large tail ended load and the grounding arrangement needs to be designed
around reduction of this short circuit current levels. These are areas that need to be addressed before
commercially closing on a PSA with the off taker.
The results are derived from a preliminary data set used for this exercise and a more detailed protection
study will be needed during the design phase of the project.

The stability analysis is done to assess the Ramu systems operating performance at a transient
interval after being exposed to disturbances. The worst type of faults must be considered to
simulate the Systems behavior during the event.
Transient Stability Calculation Conditions
As per the verification section given previously the Governor, AVR and Power system stabilizer
common modules will be used to give the time domain stability of the system.
Load flow initial conditions are used to set the base case for all RMS simulation to ensure
convergence was done at a flat run base.

system frequency reaches above system limitations to 53.231Hz in a multiple outage contingency
with internal excitation of the reference unit reaching almost a 1.p.u value indicating the swing
unit’s inability to cover the events disturbances. More visual aspects of the event is the voltage
level reaching 150.5kV far beyond the system limitations. In this instance, machine and substation
protections will operate at least a 3 second delay from the initial event causing a subsequent total
system outage. The Ramu System will not find stability if Wafi Golpu is divorced from the

reduce the oscillatory disturbance with 5-6 seconds and damping the system frequency below

rerouting of power flow through L613 carrying 101.4MW at a thermal capacity of 67.1%. This
proves the initial design of the double circuit arrangement and the control modules of the Ramu

The Simulation of the loss of Ramu 2 is logical to assume loss of system parameters as a result
of the 2 previous scenario runs. The simulation switching event at 2 seconds shows the rotor
angle at Ramu 1 AA2G3 attempting to dampen the power flow effect but to no avail. This showed
the oscillation of the system out of control once the main 132kV breakers opened at divorced
power flow from Ramu 2. System Voltage dropping to 14kV shows definite signs of a total system
outage with system frequency showing no ability of any other generation source to plateau the
generation loss event. There is without a doubt that the loss of Ramu 2 complex from the
Ramu System will cause a total system outage.

Oscillatory Stability Analysis
Modal Analysis
Modal analysis or small signal stability is used here to define the oscillatory stability of the Ramu
System with the proposed Ramu 2 interconnection. Definitions for excitation systems and
governor interfaces are once again as per plant data provided by the Project Co. The analysis
was done under the calculation method of ‘Arnoldi/Lanczos’ selective modal analysis to narrow
down the eigenvalues calculated to the smallest Magnitude with respect to the reference points.
‘10’ Eigenvalues were selected to show observability, participation factors and importantly
controllability eigenvectors. The complex reference point used for the Ramu System was ‘0+j6.28’
calculated as below:
𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒 = 1𝐻𝑧
1𝐻𝑧 × 2𝜋 = 6.28𝑟𝑎𝑑/𝑠

From the execution of the modal analysis, the above results found true in all 10 eigenvalues. The
Ramu System found stability in all cases as shown by the negative real part areas shown in the
first column indicating damping of rotor angles in all synchronous machines on the system
including Ramu 2 units. The Damping ratio and ratio between amplitudes are adjusted showing

This is concerning as all speed phasors for the system generation should find a common cluster
to ensure synchronicity is maintained. You find here as well the Ramu 2 magnitudes are dictating
the oscillation of the system. This is both good and bad as the Ramu system does require firming
in the grid. Bad in a sense that the damping factor of the system is entailed by the repression of
the Ramu 2 machines. This is shown particularly in the bar plot below of the same modes
observability.
Figure 77 Observability bar plot of mode -0.588+6.303j
Above clearly defines the oscillatory stability requirements of additional generation regardless of
the interconnection of Ramu 2. This is particularly clear for the location of PNGFP Baiune units to
the large load areas of Wafi Golpu and Harmony mine. This damping requirement shows pegging
of the generation to the closer larger loads.

Particular interest found with the phasor controllability of the Eigen Vectors with respect to the
Ramu 2 units.
Figure 78 Phasor Plot of Controllability Eigenvectors of mode -0.727+6.556j
In most of the modes, it clearly showed opposing phasor angles to other machines. Clustering
singularly and not with other power stations, this could be detrimental especially if future
development, IPPs, or even a POM system interconnection is plausible in the future. This is an
important note that vectoring requirements and excitation configurations have to be looked at to
ensure Oscillatory Stability is maintained in the Ramu System.

3. The following LOLP and EDNS areas must be addressed
Analysis Summary Issues
Scenario Run at 10MW Wafi Golpu Voltage issues at relative substations. Requires installation of static
compensation and improvement units
All other Generation at low running levels or offline
Overloading of Highland Transmission Lines
Scenario Run at 55MW Wafi Golpu Appropriate system augmentation required for Steady state stability
Generation Adequacy Analysis High LOLP Probability at 57.3% additional active power content is
required to cover this area if Ramu 2 is to be interconnected.
Dispatch able Generation unable to cover residual demand
EDNS at 4.6MW

PPL System Operations MEQ SSM Division
4. The Following Short Circuit Areas must be addressed
Area of Concern Description
Fault Ikss and ip Levels Current areas in Wafi and Ramu 2 are at the higher threshold of short circuit
peak current. This can be discussed during the connection agreement and
changes to Grounding systems in areas concerned.
Grounding Augmentations of
Ramu System areas
Area locale to the interconnection must have ground systems verified and
checked again.
5. Energization of the Interconnection Facility is only possible if the Transmission
augmentation areas highlighted are completed.
6. Stability during the several scenario runs are found as below:
Scenario Name Event Type Stability Result
Loss of one Wafi Golpu Feeder Load Switching Event Stability found true
Loss of All of Wafi Golpu Switching Event Stability found not true

7. Oscillatory Stability is only found true if all Generation points highlighted below are intact
and in synchronous with Ramu 2 units.
Station Generation Required Synced to system
Ramu AA2G1 Yes
AA2G3 Yes Required
AA2G4 Yes
AA2G5 Yes Required
YTOD AB2G2 Yes Required
Pauanda PA2G1 Yes Required
Upper Baiune BD2G1 Yes Required
Lower Baiune BA2G1 Yes
BA2G2 Yes
Katu BC2G2 Yes Required
The finding from this study lead to the opinion that the Ramu system can find relative harmony
with the inclusion of the Ramu 2 Complex. The interconnection facility is a sound and flexible
preliminary design that can allow for the successful power flow from Ramu 2 to Wafi Golpu. The
stability of the Ramu system however is not sound without the relevant system augmentations
Ramu_2 Interconnection Grid Impact Study W. Baloiloi IEPNG-3851_020820

PPL System Operations MEQ SSM Division
mentioned in this study. The installation and connection of Ramu 2 without these system
augmentations is not supported by PPL Engineering. Based on the findings as well PPL
Engineering does not support the current 3 X 77MVA generation configuration as proposed in this
design as 3 out of 4 load scenarios run with the configuration do not find stability true. To add to
this, Oscillatory stability analysis clearly show the need for a reduction in the capacity of one
synchronous unit from Ramu 2. Generation Adequacy analysis shows the need again for
reduction in the complex capacity as projected LOLP and EDNS levels are far too high with this
project.
Recommendations
1. It is recommended that the Ramu 2 Complex can be interconnected with the Ramu system
but with relevant system Augmentation listed in Table 22 and Table 24 of this document.
2. It is recommended that for stability purposes, the 3 X 77MVA generation configuration be
changed to allow a stable indices that will meet Transient, Oscillatory stability and
Generation Adequacy requirements by the Ramu System
3. It is recommended that PPL Engineering does not support this Project until the relevant
areas are addressed and another Grid Impact Study is completed to show a more
adequate result for the Ramu 2 Project.
